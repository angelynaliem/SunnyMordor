		<p>A project using Fragments, ViewPagers and TabLayouts to provide graceful access to multiple pages
			of information.  It sets up a Page Fragment and a ViewPager to allow users to swipe from one page to
			another and a TabLayout to show users where they are and allow jumping to a specific page.  I also
			included clickable text navigation in each page to support jumping to specific sections on each page.<br/><br/>
		Adding the per page navigation was a bit tricky :<br/>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I had to save the ArrayList position of the entries that started a new page section and then associate
				them with a clickable TextView
			</li>
			<li>made use of smoothScrollToPositionFromTop() to scroll to needed positions when a navigation
				TextView was clicked on
			</li>
			<li>highlighting the clicked navigation TextView was easy, but I also I had to save a pointer to it so it could be
				grayed out when a new navigation TextView was clicked on
			</li>
			<li>Getting the navigation views to highlight automatically when a user scrolled down to a new page
				section was a bit tricky, but it turned out really well.  I had to send a callback to the ArrayAdapter
				so it could tell my Fragment code when an element corresponding to a page section header was
				inflated.  Then the Fragment could highlight the corresponding navigation TextView.
			</li>
			<li>I figured out how to create a ListView of views with different formats.  A page's ListView consisted of
				section header views which consisted only of a TextView with short text in a large font size and info
				sections which consisted of an ImageView and a larger amount of text in a smaller font size.  My
				ArrayAdapter had to dynamically decide which views to show and which to hide based on what type of
				content it was showing
			</li>
		</ul>
